# Contributing Guidelines

Contributions welcome!

Hi, this project is under actively development. It's hard to maintain all of these: writing code, publishing, compiling, testing input and output files.

This project welcomes non-code contributions, too! The following types of contributions are welcome:

- **Ideas**: participate in an issue thread or start your own to have your voice heard.
- **Writing**: contribute your expertise in an area by helping expand the included content.
- **Copy editing**: fix typos, clarify language, and generally improve the quality of the content.
- **Formatting**: help keep content easy to read with consistent formatting.
- **Testing**: testing and exploring new file formats


# Project Governance

**This is an [OPEN Open Source Project](http://openopensource.org/).**

Individuals making significant and valuable contributions are given commit-access to the project to contribute as they see fit. This project is more like an open wiki than a standard guarded open source project.

## Rules

There are a few basic ground-rules for contributors:

1. **No `--force` pushes** or modifying the Git history in any way.
1. **Non-master branches** ought to be used for ongoing work.
1. No AI based features (for now)

## Releases

Declaring formal releases remains the prerogative of the project maintainer.
